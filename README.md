# 2021 Exit Velocities & Launch Angles 

#### (as of 7/29/2021)

I completed a quick examination of the relationship between exit velocities and launch angles for qualified batters during the 2021 MLB season through July 28th, 2021. 

## Data:
The data was retrieved from Baseball Savant, using only batting data for qualified batter up to July 29th for the 2021 season.

## EDA:

## Results:
There is a positive relationship between average exit velocities and launch angles. This is intuitive - one would think that if you hit the ball harder on average that the angle at which the ball leaves the bat would be greater.

Some interesting notes:
- Yankees' slugger Aaron Judge has the highest average exit velocity (95.9 mph), while Angels' David Fletcher has the lowest (82.5).
- There's no "Coors Effect" for the Rockies' Raimel Tapia. He not only owns the lowest launch angle; he is the only qualified batter with a *negative* average launch angle (-3.1 degrees).
- The Braves' re-acquired Adam Duvall ahead of the trade deadline, owner of the league leading average launch angle (24 degrees).
